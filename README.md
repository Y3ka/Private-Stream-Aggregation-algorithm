# Private-Stream-Aggregation-algorithm
Realised end 2020 for a semester project at EURECOM.

## Presentation:
This project aims at implementing the Private Stream Aggregation algorithm proposed by Elaine Shi (www.elaineshi.com/docs/ndss2011.pdf) using *Charm Crypto*.

## Content:
* PSA_charm_scheme.py: main file with the implementation of the algorithm and the definition of parameters.
* Pollard_algorithm.py: implementation of Pollard algorithm adapted for Charm Crypto.
* DD_privacy: generates graph to compare the distributed differential privacy scheme against a naive scheme.

## Use:
Run the PSA_charm_scheme after defining the desired parameters
